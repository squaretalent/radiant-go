= Import Export

Uses yaml_db (install the gem) to export the database to a yaml file.
This includes the schema_migrations, so that extension migrations continue to work

Updated to use db/data.yml, following what yaml_db does

To import use: 

 $ rake db:import

To export, browse to /admin/export or use:

 $ rake db:export
